# Numerical-Analysis-Problems-in-cpp
All problems are set for numerical analysis course in computer science engineering and follow reference book to understand different methods ( Bisection, False position, Iteration, Newton-Raphson, Ramanujan's etc) to finding real root in given equation.
All Codes written in C++ because of stl library. You've the liberty to view my codes if you're stuck.
But I highly recommend not to watch the codes before you solve these yourself.
Refference Book:Introductory methods of numerical analysis by S S Sastry, fifth edition, PHI learning private limited, New Delhi, 2012.
Practice more example to just change the function which contain equation.
If you find more efficient code to solving method, please share with everyone.
Thanks in advance.
